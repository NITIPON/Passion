##About My Self

 I am currently serving as Assistant Vice President in data analyst at CIMB Bank with wide experience in a data science competition, algorithms design and analysis, Mathematical analysis, and algebra. I graduated from the MAHIDOL University in 2018, majoring in mathematical analysis (Riesz potentials Function) and algebra. After that I participated in several data science hackathons, such as Home Hackathon 2018 (building a recommendation system for real estate products), Data Science Hackathon 2018 by RISE (building a model to identify target clients for Krungsri Bank loans), and CIMB 3D Conquest: Data Science track that my team, building credit risk model using machine learning, was one of the last grand final teams. Since then, I have been interested in machine learning and deep learning producing practical projects for the industry. Gradually, each competition further built my passion for data science and affirmed that this career is ideal. I am inquisitive develop leveraging novel technologies to enhance the efficiency of the work and share knowledge to create the future digital era.
